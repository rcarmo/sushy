Had a few minutes to check the current status quo. `hy` hasn't had a new release in almost a year and moving from Python 3.9 to 3.11 had minimal impact, so I guess it's time to do some more fixing and see if this can be turned back into a "production" Wiki engine.

Search is broken, for starters, which I really should fix.
